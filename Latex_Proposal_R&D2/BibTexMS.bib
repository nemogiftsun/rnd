annote = {* Temporarily relax the inequality constraint on the distant dof
* Clamping  - increased number of iterations and costly
                       - difficult to relax some dof clamped
* Homotopy of control law with and without inequality constraints
  - but cost is  prohibitive when complex case. Reduction of  this cost was proposed but involves very specific study for each new type of task.
* Inequalities can be encoded in Least square program
  - no possibility of enforcing priorities among them
  - most obvious approach to solve such hierarchical optimization problems is to solve single-objective optimization problems successively, in cascade
 - dedicated simplex solver
