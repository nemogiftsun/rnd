  abstract = {This article illustrates the detection of 6 degrees of freedom (DOF)
	for Virtual Environment interactions using a modified simple laser
	pointer device and a camera. The laser pointer is combined with a
	diffraction grating to project a unique laser grid onto the projection
	planes used in projection-based immersive VR setups. The distortion
	of the projected grid is used to calculate the translational and
	rotational degrees of freedom required for human-computer interaction
	purposes.},
