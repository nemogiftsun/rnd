  review = {This paper describes a low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) to
	aid in the navigation for outdoor mobile robot applications. This
	system provides low-cost, high-precision, short time duration position
	information with together an absolute sensing mechanism. 
	
	
	INS is a kind of relative positioning system. It is necessary with
	an absolute system, because absolute sensing systems such as beacons
	and landmarks use simple encoder information to predict vehicle location
	between sensing locations. As it is indicated very well in this paper,
	the problem is that these systems lose position track when the vehicle
	is not in contact with any beacon or landmark information. There
	cannot be a contact because of variations in wheel radius, tire slip
	and body deflection naturally in outdoor environments. Inertial sensing
	offers a potential solution to this type of problem. 
	
	
	The most important distinction between these papers and other papers
	is that this paper discusses not only inertial sensing and sensors,
	but also combining both inertial sensing and absolute positioning
	systems. Normally, INS is so expensive and widely used in aerospace
	applications and cheap systems provide less accurate positioning
	information. This paper contributes that cheap sensors can provide
	valuable information and introduces a hardware implementation with
	including all formulations about developing error models for each
	sensors.
	
	
	It is mentioned about sensors in more details; three gyroscopes, a
	tri-axial accelerometer, two tilt sensors for INS. Accelerometer
	measures the linear acceleration of the robot along three orthogonal
	axes on the robot frame. Tilt sensors measures deviations of the
	vehicle platform to cancel the gravity component on each axis of
	the accelerometer. Gyroscope provides information about angular velocity
	of the vehicle. Two different gyroscopes are evaluated and compared.
	It shows that different gyros may use different technology and therefore,
	give different outputs. All sensors' performances are tested by excluding
	error models from the system. 
	
	
	A simple Extended Kalman filter is described. This filter gets data
	from sensors and estimates position before supplementing the INS
	with absolute sensing mechanisms. 
	
	
	The low-cost INS is tested under laboratory conditions, and the result
	shows that estimation is reliable and useful over long period of
	time. And the INS is compared to the robot's own radar-based guidance
	in outdoors. Results show that accurate model of the INS sensors
	give valuable orientation and position information except under the
	field condition when the vibrations can be large. 
	
	
	The research is very open field for many applications. The future
	works in this paper are integration of an INS unit to other absolute
	systems such as radar and GPS, using a twin-gyroscope system on indoor
	vehicles to estimate orientation, and application of this INS to
	low-cost underwater vehicles.}

	system by using inexpensive ultrasonic sensors, radio device and
	micro-controller. In particular, the tracking system is done by integration
	of the system with Player/Stage. 
	
	The idea behind of the system is to measure time-of the flight of
	the ultrasonic signals using Trilateration method. Radio frequency
	is for clock synchronization. The system accuracy is better than
	99%. However, the system requires a fixed infrastructure which is
	disadvantage due to the fact that two or more fixed points of beacons
	should be known to determine the position of an object. After having
	at least two fixed points, and time of flight, actually finding the
	position is so simple by Heron?s equation. When there are two beacons
	only and a robot is in a position close to the line between two beacons,
	there is a huge difference from the correct position estimation.
	In fact, two beacons are sufficient for 2D positioning but in this
	paper, 8 ultrasonic beacons are used to help a robot to calculate
	its position when there are people around the robot and for also
	3D positioning. It is not indicated in that paper, the system can
	be call as complementary of GPS for indoors application. Like GPS,
	a robot calculate the position itself. This means when there is also
	more than one robot, it does not increase computational load on the
	system unlike visual tracking system. 
	
	Integration this system to Player/State provides simulations of real
	robots. It is not offered in that paper, but I offer that this integration
	can be used for educational purposes in Universities. There can be
	a room includes some special robots, and students can connect to
	this room on Internet by Player/Stage to remote the robots, so students
	or other people would have a change to program and test real robots
	from their own computers. The other missing from the paper is ignoring
	changes in temperature, because the speed of sound changes by roughly
	0.18% per Celsius. It is implied as further work , but not implemented
	by adding temperature sensors to change system?s calibration.}

	First inertial sensor is accelerometers and tilt sensor supplies

	needs universal indoor navigation method despite the many existing

	It was written 1997, still there is not such a universal system which
	works accurately and which is inexpensive. Like every survey, this

  abstract = {Instrumenting the physical world through large networks of wireless
	sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmentalmonitoring

	Pactical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost

	we review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness
	of a very simple connectivity-metric method for localization in outdoor
	environments that makes use of the inherent radio-frequency (RF)
	communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference
	points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit

	to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy
	of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between
	two adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these

  review = {This paper addresses the problem of localization which is about determining
	the position of a mobile robot or any devices. The main goal is to
	demonstrate effectiveness of a localization algorithm which use idealized
	radio model in unconstrained outdoor environments. 
	
	First of all, it presents localization approaches by showing their
	positive and negative sides. Classification of localization approaches
	is well defined in this paper. The first approach is fine-grained
	localization which includes range-finding , directionality based
	and signal matching methods. One of the key ideas is measuring the
	time of flight of the communication signal. It can be GPS which measures
	one-way flight or LPS (Pinpoint's Local Positioning System) which
	measures round-trip time. However, GPS is not practical, expensive
	and use a lot of energy. LPS is for most indoor applications. Like
	LPS, Ultrasound systems may not work in outdoors because of interference
	from ultrasound resources. Another key idea is signal strength which
	is the attenuation of the radio signal, but extensive infrastructural
	effort is required and it may be a good idea for indoors if can be
	achieved to measure signal strength by applying a Wall attenuation.
	Another idea is signal pattern matching which analyzes signal structure
	and store in its database instead of signal timing and strength,
	but also an extensive effort is needed with this idea. The another
	one is directionality which compute the angle of each reference points
	with respect to the mobile node by using a complex antenna array
	and which is costly, so this is not preferable. By the way, it is
	not very efficient in indoors because of multipath effects. The last
	idea is active badge system which was one of the systems for indoor
	environments using IR technology. IR sensors are physically wired
	in rooms of a building .It requires significant installation, and
	configuration and IR is affected by sunlight. Therefore it cannot
	be used outdoors. 
	
	This paper gets many ideas from previous works. It uses RF-based localization
	and measures signal strength of received beacon signals to estimate
	the distance. Some definitions and formulas are given, which are
	pretty clear. For these formulas, it is assumed that perfect spherical
	radio propagation is used and all radios are identical. They both
	test their system in indoors and outdoors. Like some systems, they
	are not successful in indoors because of walls. They use very simple,
	so very cheap model but it works with 87% accuracy in outdoors, and
	very effective .The good job is for experimental results, they test
	their model many times by changing the distances and they give persuasive
	results.
	
	The paper also well outlines future work. This paper was published
	in 2000, For 8 years, electronics technology has been improved a
	lot, so nowadays this kind of model can be implemented with more
	accurately and cheaper without having many problems such as the collision
	avoidance problem in this paper.}

  abstract = {One of the obstacles to the proliferation the VR technology to digital
	contents is the expensive, intrusive, cumbersome and brittle nature
	of the sensors that are required to detect user's intent. While optical
	tracking, being wireless with respect to the user's body, has been
	regarded as one solution to this usability aspect, the traditional
	problems of establishing marker correspondence and resolving their
	occlusions in real time still remain. One avenue of efforts to address
	these problems is to simply add more and more hardware (or processing
	power), making the tracking system too expensive for general usage,
	while another major effort looks to directly track human body parts,
	but usually suffers from the inability to track point features. In
	this paper, we present a relatively inexpensive (e.g. runs on a high-end
	PC), but reasonably accurate real time optical motion tracking system,
	called the 'POSTRACK', that can still find a wide range of applications
	for VR. POSTRACK uses four cheap 8-bit grayscale cameras attached
	with infrared LED?s, and the user wears several (1~5) highly reflective
	markers. The markers are ?designed? to be very easy to wear (snap-on),
	and even fashionable. The four cameras are calibrated using well
	known algorithms, and the initial marker assignments are found by
	a simple heuristic based on the normal human posture, while the fundamental
	matrices are used to find blob correspondence and compute the 3D
	positions of the markers. Since the snap-on markers are rather large
	and their positions are computed from their image centroids (which
	constantly change), the computed 3D position data are jittery, more
	so than other trackers that use much smaller marker sizes, or compared
	to magnetic trackers. While the technology is old (i.e. uses standard

	a good balance between cost and its capability, and we demonstrate

	such as wrists, ankles, belly to estimate human body motions and
	can be used for animation applications such as motion-dance training
	system. In this paper, this system is compared with a magnetic tracker
	and shows their performances which are almost same, but magnetic
	tracker is expensive. This system is good system because of being
	sufficiently cost effective, because camera technology does not cost
	much nowadays. I could be more cost effective if it were an embedded
	system.}

  abstract = {{Augmented reality has now progressed to the point where real-time
	applications are required and being considered. At the same time
	it is important that synthetic elements are rendered and aligned
	in the scene in an accurate and visually acceptable way. In order
	to address these issues a real-time, robust and efficient 3D model-based
	tracking algorithm is proposed for a 'video see through' monocular
	vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating
	the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can
	then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, non-linear
	pose computation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing
	approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curve interaction
	matrices is given for different features including lines, circles,
	cylinders and spheres. A local moving edge tracker is used in order
	to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours.
	A method is proposed for combining local position uncertainty and
	global pose uncertainty in an efficient and accurate way by propagating
	uncertainty. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator
	into the visual control law via an iteratively re-weighted least
	squares implementation. The method presented in this paper has been
	validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments.
	Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination
	and mistracking.}},

	This paper describes an attitude determination system that is based

	describes these technologies under separated titles. Each description
	is written elaborately and for some technologies, it links to some
	web pages or point to other articles which include more details.
	There are some real examples about these technologies. Furthermore,
	in this paper, all technologies are mentioned about not only for
	robotics applications but also for other many applications. These
	are why it has been cited many times by others.
	
	It starts to mention about location systems properties in more details.
	There are three major techniques. These techniques are triangulation
	(angulation), proximity and scene analysis. A location system implementation
	uses at least one of these techniques to locate an object. Later
	on, it describes physical position and symbolic location, and accuracy,
	precision, scaling, cost and limitations with examples. 
	
	The technologies, which are mentioned in these paper, are GPS, Active
	Badges, Active Bats, MotionStar, VHF Omini-directional Rangin, Cricket,
	MSR RADAR, PinPoint 3D-iD RF lateration, Avalacnhe Transceivers,
	Easy Living, Smart Floor, Automatic ID systems, Wireless Andrew,
	E911, SpotON. As it seems, there are many location sensing technologies.
	It shows that this field is enough mature. Some technologies are
	better but expensive. Therefore, future works have to focus on lowering
	cost, reducing the amount of infrastructure, improving scalability,
	and creating flexible system. This paper encourages researchers to
	investigate how to best obtain and represent error distribution,
	system accuracy, precision and relevant dependencies of location
	sensing systems. Finally this paper tells that an application could
	be nice to simulate these techniques because of the fact that it
	would provide us to avoid the cost of purchasing, deploying and configuring
	a hardware infrastructure. Also, it is mentioned that preliminary
	work on simulator idea has begun.},

	low-cost, rich and flexible features to design. 
	
	This paper covers and criticizes some products such as robot Aibo,
	vacuum cleaner Trilobite, and iRobot?s Roomba which are service robots.
	These products are very good example to understand the idea behind
	of these core technologies. For example, Roomba, which is shown in
	classroom by Dear Prof. Prassler, performs random navigation for
	floor coverage and tactile sensing. It is a cheap robot, but does
	not guarantee to cover all floor and not reasonable for power consumption.
	
	
	The main purpose of this paper is to describe these technologies.
	In particular, basic requirements are to be low-cost to be employed
	in service robots, to have a short time to market, and to provide
	intelligent features. 
	
	The first technology is object recognition by using a single low cost
	camera. It supports navigation and mapping and can be used for object
	identification, hand-eye coordination. Object recognition has two
	algorithms; training and recognition. It is invariant in rotation,
	scaling, lighting, occlusions. The second technology is VSLAM, which
	is robust and requires no initial map. It can operate in a previously
	unknown environment to build a map and localize itself. It is compared
	with SLAM. Unlike SLAM, It uses wheel encoders and a low cost camera
	for localization of the robot instead of laser range sensor. Therefore,
	it handles dynamic changes in the environment while SLAM fails in
	cluttered environments. In this paper, vSLAM algorithm steps are
	described . The third technology is ERSP , which provides basic components
	and tools for rapid development and prototyping of robotics applications
	and it allows designer to reconfigure in an easy way.

  abstract = {In the medical field, there is a need for small ambulatory sensor
	systems for measuring the kinematics of body segments. Current methods
	for ambulatory measurement of body orientation have limited accuracy
	when the body moves. The aim of the paper was to develop and validate
	a method for accurate measurement of the orientation of human body
	segments using an inertial measurement unit (IMU). An IMU containing
	three single-axis accelerometers and three single-axis micromachined
	gyroscopes was assembled in a rectangular box, sized 20?20?30 mm.
	The presented orientation estimation algorithm continuously corrected
	orientation estimates obtained by mathematical integration of the
	3D angular velocity measured using the gyroscopes. The correction
	was performed using an inclination estimate continuously obtained
	using the signal of the 3D accelerometer. This reduces the integration
	drift that originates from errors in the angular velocity signal.
	In addition, the gyroscope offset was continuously recalibrated.
	The method was realised using a Kalman filter that took into account
	the spectra of the signals involved as well as a fluctuating gyroscope
	offset. The method was tested for movements of the pelvis, trunk
	and forearm. Although the problem of integration drift around the
	global vertical continuously increased in the order of 0.5?s ?1,
	the inclination estimate was accurate within 3? RMS. It was shown
	that the gyroscope offset could be estimated continuously during
	a trial. Using an initial offset error of 1 rads ?1, after 2 min
	the offset error was roughly 5% of the original offset error. Using
	the Kalman filter described, an accurate and robust system for ambulatory
	motion recording can be realised.},

  review = {This paper presents a position estimation system which uses sound
	and time of the flight of it. In formulation, it does not use the
	speed of the sound to eliminate environment changes. This system
	is not indicated as low cost, but this kind of system can be implemented
	in a low cost. Firstly, it describes already available position estimation
	systems and their problems. It makes a general definition for modern
	systems which transmit and receive wave pulses to measure a distance
	or a direction, or collects the measurements to triangulate a coordinate.
	Secondly, this paper presents two different formulations of position
	estimation using time of flights of different receivers. Formulations
	are differentiated by using circular math features, because sound
	travels in a circular wave. One formulation uses speed of the sound
	as the other does not use. They system can balance for environment
	changes by including the speed of the sound as unknown. In this system,
	for 2D, there are four receivers and 1 transmitter. The idea is to
	use the first ( closest one to transmitter ) receiver's time of the
	flight as base signal to ignore the speed of the light, then solving
	the unknowns by least square method ( I like this method a lot, because
	it gives the best approximate solution). In addition, this paper
	also works on minimizing errors by considering attenuation in the
	air, misalignment between transducers, multiple refections and occlusions
	of some receivers. In that system, receivers detect the peak value
	of the signal and therefore, just it is needed to know the time differences
	between receivers. This papers describes the solutions briefly and
	just indicates that this one is in hardware level or software level
	for minimizing the problems. It does not give more details about
	solutions in the manner of hardware or programming. In that paper,
	it is indicated that Kalman filter is not used for 3D but it is believed
	that it improve the results using Kalman filter. It is said that
	simulations are performed in 2D and 3D to determine errors. For test
	2D, ultrasonic transducers work at 75kHz, and the receivers measures
	time of the flight at 5MHz. There is a table which shows actual and
	estimated distance. The accuracy is in 1% error. As future work,
	they aims to make the accuracy better. This paper does not give any
	results of distance more than 1000 mm, this range is nothing if it
	does not work more than this distance which is not mentioned in that
	paper. One future work, what offered in that paper, is likable for
	autonomous systems. It is to improve some algorithms to provide some
	learning capabilities so that the system can operate at optimum levels
	in the intelligent sensor manner.},

	mini-robot has two sensors. First one is IR proximity sensors for

	relatively accurate. Each robot has 3 wheels. Two of them are steering
	wheels having independent motors and these motors are controlled
	by steering module according to generated trajectory. Furthermore,
	each mini-robot has I.R. emitter/receiver for communicating between
	another mini robot or host. One robot is called as master while the
	others are called as slave. Each mini robot collects partial information,
	and creates its own map, and when two robots meet, they transfer
	their information to each others. In general, all information is
	collected by the master robot. This paper claims that the master-multi
	slave strategy provides to generate a map better than Master robot
	can do itself. I believe this claim because there are some other
	papers also use the same strategy to explore unknown environment.
	Though, this claims are not shown with good results in this paper.
	Each mini robot moves randomly because this paper believes that this
	increases the global efficiency. But, sometimes randomly movement
	cause a lot of energy consumption. Luckily, this paper works on also
	some probabilistic results for movement. Basically, each mini robot
	performs random behavior, that is, the vehicle turns -+ 45 degree
	randomly when there is an obstacle. Fuzzy logic-based algorithm is
	used for combining partial maps and this algorithm is described with
	given codes. Each slave vehicle can store of up to 40x40m, as the
	master one store larger are. It is said that this paper has the problem
	when same wall or obstacle is detected by more than one mini robot.
	This paper tries to solve that problem by comparing the shape of
	segment basically. This paper is assumed as first results of a kind
	of small autonomous vehicle in 1995.

  abstract = {This paper presents a distributed particle filter algorithm for localizing
	multiple mobile robots that are equipped only with low cost/low power
	sensors. This method is applicable to multi-micro robot systems,
	where size limitations restrict sensor selection (e.g. small infrared
	range finders). Localization of three robots in a known environment
	is conducted by combining measurements from a small number of simple
	range sensors with inter-robot distances obtained through an acoustic
	range finder system. The localization problem is formulated as estimating
	the global position and orientation of a single triangle, where corners
	of the triangle represent the positions of robots. The robot positions
	relative to the centroid of the triangle are then determined by trilateration
	using the inter-robot distance measurements. Each robot uses an identical
	particle filter algorithm to estimate the global position of the
	triangle. The best estimates determined by each particle filter are
	distributed among the robots for use in the following iteration.
	Simulations demonstrate the ability to perform global localization
	of three robots, each using a compass and two range finders. The
	results illustrate that this method can globally localize the robot
	team in a simulated indoor environment. The results are compared

	this paper discuss about numerous investigated methods of localizing

	the small robot because of using GPS, scanning lasers, and cameras.
	In this paper, the robots use two fixed range sensors (IR), a compass
	to sense orientation, two range finders to measure the distance between
	pairs of robots. The sensors are limited in size, power, and number.
	The main purpose is to share limited sensory data and computational
	resources among the robots for a better estimation. In order to estimate
	all robot positions, each robot uses particle filter, which is described
	deeply in that paper. That is, each robot estimates its own place
	using only data from its own sensors and then share this data with
	other robots. Now, each robot has sensors readings from all robots
	information to combine the sensor readings using distributed method
	which is described to share best estimates. Simulation results are
	shown for position and sensors error on the graphs. Results show
	that cooperation amongst the robots is better to estimate positions
	of robots than each robot estimates its own position individually.

	nodes to learn their physical location by using listeners that hear
	and analyze information from beacons spread throughout the building.
	Cricket is the result of several design goals, including user privacy,
	decentralized administration, network heterogeneity, and low cost.
	Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices
	learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this
	information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or
	control and there is no explicit coordination between beacons; it
	provides information to devices regardless of their type of network

	components and costs less than U.S. $10. We describe the randomized
	algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent
	radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference
	algorithms to overcome multipath and interference, and practical
	beacon configuration and positioning techniques that improve accuracy.

	support system, which is called as Cricket. It is a location support
	system which is low-cost (beacon and listener :< $10) and it also
	provides user privacy, decentralized administration, network heterogeneity.
	A beacon consists of a PIC micro-controller, a RF transmitter and
	an ultrasonic transmitter while a listener consists of identical
	controller, a RF receiver and an ultrasonic receiver with a tone
	detector. It is a cheap design hardware, but it is not designed for
	low power consumption. It is not indicated in this paper, but also
	can be designed for low power in the future. 
	
	In Cricket, speed of sound in air is the idea. It measures the one-way
	propagation time of ultrasonic signals from beacon to listener. When
	the listener gets RF signal, it is to turn on its ultrasonic receiver
	for listening ultrasonic pulse. Time difference between this pulse
	and the first RF signal bit is used to estimate the position. Most
	of the positioning systems use that method but using different techniques.
	This paper also presents ideas to minimize errors of the system.
	It solves the humidity and temperature problems with speed of sound
	by using relativeley coarse-grained location information while other
	papers cannot solve that problem. Different scenarios are assumed
	for better experiment. These experiments test boundary performance,
	different three listener inference algorithms, which are Majority,
	Min-Mean, Min-Mode, and mobile performance. It is also planned to
	measure the accuracy of the hardware in the future.
	
	In this paper, Cricket is compared with Bat, Active Badge, Radar systems.
	The benefits and limitations of these systems are discussed, beside
	that showing some similarities of them. In Bat system, there is a
	central control of the system while cricket had no central control.
	It makes it simpler, and reduces management cost. Like Bat, Active
	Badge is difficult with matrix of sensors. In other words, Active
	Badge and Bat is more expensive than Cricket. Radar uses the RF signal
	strength as an indicator of the distance between transmitter and
	receiver. It works only with one network. In conclusion, Cricket
	,which is a location support-system, is cheap, easy to implement
	. Active map and location-based services can be implemented.}

  review = {This paper presents a low cost flight control system which uses visual
	and inertial sensors to develop an autonomous flying vehicle. In
	this paper, only a small experimental helicopter is used for testing
	the system and architecture of it is described. Actually, this work
	was a part of an ongoing research project in 2002.
	
	
	The main problem is how to estimate and control attitude, height and
	motion of a vehicle. The attitude estimation problem is solved by
	using inertial sensors and complementary filter. GPS receivers also
	can be used for that aim, in fact it is more expensive and less robust.
	Before mentioning how to determine attitude in more detail, it would
	be better to mention about commercial systems for this application,
	but probably it is supposed to be so expensive, heavy and large.
	Instead of commercial one, a low-cost, low-weight and smaller inertial
	measurement unit is developed .This unit includes three Murata ENC-03J
	solid-state rate gyros, and two Analog Devices dual-axis ADXL202JQC
	accelerometers which are known as inertial sensors, and HC12 micro-controller
	and Honeywell HMC1001/2 magnetometers. But the authors do not give
	any circuits of this developed unit except its picture.
	
	
	Rate gyros measure rate of rotation, and integration the angular rate
	gives the the angle of rotation. Accelerometers measures tilt angles
	(roll and pitch) with respect to gravity. For X,Y,Z axis, three magnetometers
	give the heading reference. Complementary filter provides to combine
	the positive features of inertial sensors and to eliminate their
	errors for determining attitude. In order to control attitude, three
	independent proportional controllers ( for roll, pitch, yaw) are
	used and their performances are showed on figures. In order to estimate
	height and motion of a vehicle, two 1/3 inch inhouse color CMOS cameras
	are used which provides images 144 x 384 at 50Hz forward-down-looking
	and forward facing. About height estimation, only the approach is
	addressed to another article. It is based on estimating correspondence
	of corner features on frames. For motion estimation, sequential frames
	are the starting point for velocity and odometry. Experimental results
	are given such as height results, image motion result, ground speed
	results. The results are fitted to each others on figures.
	
	
	The results would be more convincing if the authors provided more
	details about how to estimate height and motions in a theoretical
	way. Also Inertial measurement unit is still unknown, because it
	is commercially available. In other words, nobody would develop the
	low-cost unit by using only this article.}

	Furthermore, this system, what this paper presents, is not a low

	of GPS are slow update rate and signal reflections ( or blocks )
	to receive the satellite signals. INS is the complementary of GPS

	Equations are given such as INS , error , Kalman filter, discrete

	Kalman Filter synchronizes the sensory data from GPS and INS with

	In fact, this paper is focusing on just estimation errors. Finally,

	by using commercial low cost dual GPS units. This papers focuses
	on auto-landing and -takeoff. GPS and Kalman Filter are described
	firstly and this paper explains why it prefers to use dual GPS units
	to decrease position error. For a helicopter position, it is said
	that there are a variety of sensors and estimation architecture in
	that paper, but it is not truth. Yes, there are many articles about
	this, all mentioned about the same sensors and similar techniques.
	Common INS sensors are gyroscopes, accelerometers ,and common technique
	is Kalman filter to combine sensory data for position estimation.
	In this paper, something looks new. Without using any INS sensors,
	one GPS unit is installed in the ground control station while the
	other one is with the body of helicopter. It is to guess the noise
	(due to atmospheric refraction, or vapor, dust in the air) on the
	GPS sensor to use in a noise model of GPS data for a better position
	estimation. This paper says that Kalman filter is used with white
	noise, but GPS noise is different than white noise. Due to that reason,
	recursive least square method is used to be able to use estimated
	noise with Kalman filter. The noise estimation and modified Kalman
	filter equations are given in this paper. Simulations shows error
	graphs comparing GPS error, Kalman filter error, and this paper's
	estimation error. As a result, modified Kalman filter gives a better
	result in this helicopter case. While other articles use INS, this
	paper does not use. It is the deficit of this paper. As I believe,
	results are more accurately with INS sensors. In conclusion, if this
	paper adds inertial sensors to their system, the overall cost will
	be increased. It is not indicated also in that paper that this system
	is not a system for indoors because of GPS. Therefore, this helicopter
	is not useful for such application as indoor rescue operations which
	is mentioned in other papers.}

	especially humans. A real time motion-tracking system was presented
	and evaluated in this paper. System sensors were built using tri-axis
	microelectromechanical accelerometers, rate gyros, and magnetometers.
	A Kalman-based fusion algorithm was applied to obtain dynamic orientations
	and further positions of segments of the subject's body. The system
	with the proposed algorithm was evaluated via dynamically measuring
	Euler orientation and comparing with other two conventional methods.
	An arm motion experiment was demonstrated using the developed system
	and algorithm. The results validated the effectiveness of the proposed
	method.},
